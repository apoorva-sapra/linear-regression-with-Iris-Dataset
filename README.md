<h1>linear-regression-with-Iris-Dataset</h1>
The Iris flower dataset is a multivariate.It is a typical testcase for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each.
There are four numeric properties about those classes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

So, in total there are 150 records under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.

Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant
 
This project makes use of Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries(Seaborn and matplotlib).

The purpose of this project is to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization.
